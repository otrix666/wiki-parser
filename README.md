# Wikipedia Parser Evolution Project

A sophisticated Wikipedia parser that demonstrates the progression from simple synchronous parsing to high-performance asynchronous implementation. This project showcases different approaches to web scraping, implementing various Python technologies and concurrency patterns.

## üöÄ Features

- Multiple implementation levels showcasing different approaches to parsing
- Configurable parsing depth for Wikipedia articles
- Performance benchmarks for each implementation
- Docker support with PostgreSQL and Redis integration
- Code quality enforcement using Ruff linter

## üìä Performance Comparison

| Implementation | Time (seconds) | Technologies Used                                                  |
|----------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Simple | 357.45 | sqlite, urllib, re                                                 |
| Intermediate | 275.67 | redis, psycopg, requests, bs4, lxml, re                            |
| Upper-Intermediate | 71.81 | threading, multiprocessing, psycopg, redis, requests,bs4, lxml, re |
| Advanced | 28.35 | asyncio, aiohttp, asyncpg, bs4, lxml, multiprocessing, re          |
